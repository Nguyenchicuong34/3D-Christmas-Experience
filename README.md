###  Introduction
A visually stunning 3D web application created to celebrate the holiday season. This project utilizes **Three.js** (WebGL) to render a real-time interactive scene directly in the browser without any plugins.

The project demonstrates my ability to handle **3D coordinate systems**, **lighting physics**, **particle systems**, and **camera animations**.

###  Key Features
* ** Procedural 3D Generation:** The Christmas tree, gifts, and decorations are generated via code (using Cylinder, Cone, and Sphere geometries), not just imported models.
* ** Particle System:** Custom algorithm for falling snow and magical dust effects with randomized physics.
* ** Dynamic Lighting:** Uses `SpotLight`, `PointLight`, and `AmbientLight` with real-time shadow casting (Shadow Map).
* ** Interactive Camera:** Integrated `OrbitControls` allowing users to rotate, zoom, and pan around the scene.
* ** Responsive:** Automatically adjusts camera aspect ratio when resizing the browser window.

###  Technology Stack
* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3.
* **3D Library:** Three.js (ES6 Modules).
* **Control:** OrbitControls.js.
